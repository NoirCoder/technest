## Writing Tips

### Be Specific and Detailed
❌ "The keyboard feels great to type on."
✅ "The PBT keycaps have a pleasant texture, and the pre-lubed stabilizers eliminate rattle on the spacebar and larger keys. After 8 hours of typing, my fingers felt less fatigued compared to my previous membrane keyboard."

### Use Headers Strategically
- H1: Title only (one per page)
- H2: Main sections
- H3: Subsections
- H4: Minor details

This creates a good table of contents and helps SEO.

### Include Visuals
Use external image URLs:
- Product photos from manufacturer
- Amazon product images
- Official press images

## Design & Build Quality

The Logitech MX Master 3S features a premium build with a soft-touch plastic shell and a metal scroll wheel. At 141 grams, it's slightly heavier than typical office mice, but this weight contributes to a solid, high-quality feel.

### Ergonomics

The sculpted right-handed shape fits naturally in your palm. The thumb rest and angled design...

## Features & Specifications

Here's what you get with the MX Master 3S:

- **Sensor**: Darkfield 8000 DPI
- **Battery**: Up to 70 days (rechargeable)
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth or USB receiver (included)
- **Buttons**: 7 programmable buttons

## Performance

I tested the MX Master 3S for 3 weeks...

## Price & Value

At $99, the MX Master 3S sits at the premium end of productivity mice. Is it worth it?

**Compared to alternatives:**
- Logitech MX Master 2S: $79 (older model, noisier clicks)
- Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic: $59 (fewer features)
- Razer Pro Click: $99 (similar price, less software support)

For daily productivity work, the $99 investment pays off...

## Final Thoughts

The Logitech MX Master 3S is the best productivity mouse I've tested in 2026...
